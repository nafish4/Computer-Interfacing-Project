# Computer-Interfacing-Project

A smart home system is designed to make the life of the owner easier and more peaceful. In our
smart home system, we incorporated intruder alarms, water level detection, water quality
identification, and fire detection. They work as a unit to notify our house in case of any sort of
emergency and take necessary actions. Further despcription is available in the project report.
